# 0HM400-DataDashboard

**Helping students take charge of their learning through data.**

## Overview

In today’s world of blended and personalized education, students need more than just access to learning materials — they need insight into how they learn. **0HM400-DataDashboard** is a student-focused dashboard developed by our group (Challenge Group 2-2) to visualize learning behaviors using Canvas clickstream data.

Our aim is to promote self-awareness, encourage goal-setting, and support students in becoming more self-regulated learners.

This project was created as part of Challenge 2 in the 0HM400 course at TU/e, where we explore practical applications of Learning Analytics.

## What It Does

- Visualizes real (pseudonymized) student interaction data from Canvas  
- Reveals patterns in learning activity and engagement  
- Enables personalized feedback and reflection  
- Built with RShiny, using data pipelines in both R and Python  

## Tech Stack

- **Backend / Data Processing:** R, RShiny, Azure Databricks  
- **Visualization:** RShiny, ggplot2, plotly  
- **Data Source:** Canvas LMS clickstream data (pseudonymized)
